Concentration Game in Android
This project was one of the homeworks of the Operating Systems course.  
I implemented a concentration game in Android. 
Main purpose of this game is using threads, using shared objects with multithread systems. 
This game gets images from internet using Pixabay API. 
It places images randomly created threads in accordance with the downloading time.
